### Controlling the behaviour via option data](https://github.com/restarian/bracket_print/blob/master/docs/usage_and_examples/advanced_usage/controlling_the_behaviour_via_option_data.md)
Bracket Print includes two unique level styles in both light and dark. The style for *level 1* is generally expected to be used for normal (generic), logging. The *level 2* style is expected (but not mandated), to be used for error logs. A new style must be set to the style map for levels other than 1 or 2 to be used.
