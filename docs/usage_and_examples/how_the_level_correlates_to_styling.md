### The *level* option is multi-faceted
#### The style to apply (and whether or not Bracket print will do anything at all), is dependent on what *level* is set to any particular instance.
Bracket Print includes two unique level styles in both light and dark themes. The style for *level 1* is generally expected to be used for normal (generic), logging. The *level 2* style is expected (but not mandated), to be used for error logs. A new style must be set to the style map for levels other than 1 or 2 to be used. 

Below is some pictorial screenshots of the *level* option being used with the *theme* option in both Windows and Ubuntu. This output can be reproduced in the *example -> themes_and_styles.js* example script.
